# FAML
I've made this data serializator because of several reasons
1. There's no TOML or YAML implementation for haxe that is still active
2. YAML syntax is weird.
3. JSON is also a pain in the ass

## Installation
```
haxelib git faml https://github.com/Snirozu/Faml
```

## Example
```
string: something here
number: 352.50
bool: false
list: [
    " S P A C E ! ! ",
    false
]
```

##### This whole code was written in like 3 hours smh
###### I'll probably add key-in-key support later, maybe
